### Description

Okay, I give in... This is a nice and easy to use animated (scrolling - flickerfree!) About Box with quite a number of color themes. Shows how to make standard command buttons round and a few other goodies. Just add it to your project, set a few properties and you are GO. How-To is included in the code. Try it, download is only 7 kB.
